This command is used to minify and push assets up to S3:

Development Usage
=================

  bosco -e development s3push

This will push the 'default' build up to S3, which in most typical setups will be the Compoxure include for that environment.  

If you want to push a specific feature, use the -b (branch) parameter:

  bosco -e development -b myfeature s3push

Further Environments
=================

You can push to any environment by changing the -e parameter, and adding -n will stop the prompt, allowing the command to run on a build server:

  bosco -e staging -n s3push top
